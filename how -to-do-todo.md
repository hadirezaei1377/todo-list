This application has only one user who can define different categories and create different tasks in each category.

In the first step, we list the entities we need... like categories ...

The next step is to think about the behaviors and characteristics of each entity.
Part of this thought comes from the business side.
Another aspect is technical.
For example, the items related to the existence of the technical application (port and server, etc.)  ----> entities.png

The next step is behavior analysis: how do the entities behave?
 ----> behavior.png

Now we need to add behaviors to entities
 ----> final.png
